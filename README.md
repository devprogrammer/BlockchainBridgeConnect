# Unity-Solana Wallet
The First Open-Source Unity-Solana Wallet with NFT support

The Unity-Solana Wallet is an essential bridge connecting game developers and the Solana blockchain. With Solanaâ€™s quick and low-cost transactions, games can start using blockchain technology like never before - in real-time. Thousands of developers will bring millions of players into the Solana ecosystem. This will, in turn, make the Solana projects benefit from an increased number of participants, and cross-protocol interoperability in games will take us beyond the current understanding of DeFi.  
  
Unity-Solana Wallet uses Solnet's implementation .NET SDK, but we had to modify the library to make it Unity compatible with .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 4.x.
Solnet is Solana's .NET SDK to integrate with the .NET ecosystem.  [Solnet](https://blockmountain.io/Solnet/).
